<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Julie and I am 21 years old. I am a beginner in coding and would
  like to improve my skills everyday a bit more.
</p>

<p>
  Besides coding I like to play video games like League of Legends and Genshin
  Impact. Furthermore I like to draw on my Ipad anime characters/cartoons.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot for me to learn still but it is exciting to see how much
  knowledge someone can aquire and how much you can improve in a short time. A
  few characterstics about me are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>trustworthy</li>
  <li>loyal</li>
  <li>bubbly</li>
  <li>attentive</li>
  <li>responsible</li>
</ul>

<p>I am excited to show my work and progress with you all.</p>
